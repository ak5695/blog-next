summary: "My creativity is dead. Like David Foster Wallace, I see that life's 'water is murky,' but lacking his final courage, I find a grim peace in accepting the long, slow sinking into apathy."

It’s already spring. Grass grows, flowers bloom. Boars mount sows in the name of love.

已是春天，草长花开，公猪骑上母猪开始恩爱。

But my creativity whithers day by day, drooping like a sunflower whose roots have rotted.

然而，我的创造力一天天萎靡，耷拉得像烂了根的向日葵。

When Wallace reached middle age, he wrapped a rope around his neck and ended his forty-six years.

华莱士中年时，往脖子套上绳，挂掉他四十六年的一生。

He once said: life is like water, and people are fish. Don’t forget what water is.

是他说生活如水，人就是鱼，别忘了水是什么。

I heard that in my teens and remembered it for years.

我十多岁听来这个提醒，往后多年谨记于心。

But the more I look, the more I see: the water is murky. And hard to love.

只是越发看到，这水很浑浊，令人生厌。

I don’t have Wallace’s courage to die.

我没有华莱士赴死的勇气，

There’s still so much I care about. So many longings.

尚有很多牵挂和渴望，

And sometimes, in brief flashes, I still get the urge to live.

还能间歇性地勃起生活的欲望。

But desire isn’t a miracle drug.

但欲望不是神药，

And life can’t always move forward in a state of full arousal.

生活也无法承受永远充血行进之重。

My creativity is dead.

我的创造力死了，

It died even earlier than Wallace did—collapsed in spring, before it ever got to bloom.

比华莱士死得还早，还没开花就倒在春天里。

I look up, and between the sunlight and the struggle, I see clouds floating freely—me, but not me.

我抬起头，在阳光和苦难之间，看见白云悠然，似我非我。

I don’t feel pain. I feel peace.

我没有痛苦，而是平和，

The peace of a flower bud falling silently into the slow current of time.

平和如花苞掉落在悄悄的时间流水上。

I think, I’ll be dead for a long time.

我就想，我会死去很久，

Sinking to the bottom of time’s river.

彻底沉在时间的河底，

No need to hurry.

不必这么着急沉下去。

At least, open my chest once more. And say this: Fuck.

至少先敞开胸怀，提上一句：草。
