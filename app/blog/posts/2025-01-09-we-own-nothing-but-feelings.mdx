summary: Life is just doing things on a timeline until you die. We don't own houses, money, fame, or even memories—only the fleeting feelings they produce in the body and brain. Everything else is abstraction.

Life is just doing things—willingly or not—along a timeline, then dying. That's its essence. It isn't complicated.

人生，就是在时间轴上或主动或被迫做一些事情，最终死掉。这就是它的本质，不是很复杂。

The biggest constraint is the timeline itself. Long ones last a hundred years or so, short ones only a few years or hours.

它最大的限定，是时间轴。长的百来年，短的只有几年或者几个小时。

Some people say the soul reincarnates, so this isn't our only life. I don't buy that. In this world, we exist only once.

有人会说有灵魂转世，并不是只有一次生命。这我就不认同，人在现世里只有一次存在。

First, the hallmark of reincarnation would be continuous memory, yet most of us can't recall what sins we committed in a past life to end up slaving away in this one.

首先，灵魂转世的基本特征是记忆连续，而我们大多数人都想不起上辈子造过什么孽导致这辈子做牛马。

Second, even if we drank Meng Po's soup and forgot everything, a person's existence is unified by continuous memory. A break in memory means the next life belongs to someone else—another person, another life.

其次，就算喝过孟婆汤忘却前世记忆，但人的存在乃是以连续的记忆作为统一体的，记忆断层就意味着下辈子是另一个人的存在，另一个人的生命，另一个人的人生。

Finally, if there's no reincarnation, then we truly have only this one existence.

最后，如果没有灵魂转世呢，那不就只有一次存在？

Everything we do in life comes down to feelings for the person doing it.

人生所做的一切事，对他来说只有感受。

That's because our essence is biological. Every contact with the world is mediated by our body. After death, there are no feelings belonging to us—the body is gone, so nothing that happens afterward can be sensed.

这是因为，人的本质就是生物体，我们与世界的一切接触都间隔着我们的生物体。而死后的感受不归属于我们，因生物体消亡以后就无法感知死后发生的一切。

Everything we experience, everything we "own," reaches us as light waves, sound waves, or fundamental forces hitting our senses, turning into electrical signals that travel to the brain's neurons and become what we call consciousness. Basic middle-school biology.

我们所经历的一切事物，拥有的一切物体，是事物经过光线、声波、基本力，被生物感官接收、转成电信号传导到大脑神经元，从而形成我们所谓的意识。这是初中生物学知识。

Even if brain-computer interfaces mature and bypass the senses to inject signals straight into neurons, we still get only feelings—just through a shorter path. The brain is the body's sexiest sense organ. So in the end: feelings, nothing but feelings.

即便将来有成熟的脑机连接技术，绕过身体感官，直连大脑神经元传递电信号，我们得到的仍是感受，只是路径更短。要知道，大脑是人体最性感的感官。因此，概括来说就是感受，只有感受。

In everyday life, vast wealth is a string of numbers on a screen hitting your retinas. Cash it out and it's a heavy bag of paper. Spend some on a house and you get a concrete shell you can walk in and out of freely. Spend some on marriage and one particular person starts appearing beside you often.

具体到日常生活，所谓家财万贯，是账户上一串数字映入眼帘。把它们提取出来，就变成沉甸甸一袋纸。掏出来买一套房，就会看到一个可随便进出的混凝土结构包裹的空间。花部分钱结婚，就能看到经常看到一个人在身边。

Talk with her, walk with her, make love, and you get the feeling of companionship. Spend some to direct people and you watch them move—frowning in frustration or focused in work. When the business does well, you see cheering faces. A group dinner brings tastes on the tongue and fullness in the belly. Good conversation is pleasant vibrations on the eardrums.

经常和她交流散步做爱，就会得到同类的陪伴。再花部分钱去指挥人，就看到他们在行动，皱眉苦恼、专注投入。这些人业务做得好，看到的则是欢呼雀跃的画面。一伙人吃大餐庆祝，就会得到味蕾的刺激和腹部的饱足。交谈甚欢，就是耳膜接收到舒服的声波......

Everything that happens converts, when it reaches you, into electrical signals—plain old feelings. That's feeling-ism.

一切事情的发生，回归到人本体上，都会转化成电信号，俗称的感受。这就是感受主义。

People decide to do things for some meaning—sunbathe, buy a house, fight for a championship, marry, start a company, enter politics, discover laws, become famous—but the essence is chasing feelings.

人为了某种意义决定做某些事，比如晒太阳、买房、争夺冠军、成家、创业、从政、发现定律、扬名立万，本质上都是寻求感受。

The feeling of comfort, belonging, safety; standing on the podium; receiving flowers; being eagerly shaken hands with; warmth; concern from others; paying without looking at the amount.

舒服的感受、归属的感受、安全的感受，站在领奖台的感受，被人送鲜花的感受，被人主动握手的感受，温馨的感受，被人嘘寒问暖的感受，扫码支付不看金额的感受。

The feeling of making others move left and right; being admired with shining eyes; worshipped with cheers; being remembered and mentioned over and over; the pride that your work will outlast you.

支配他人左动右动的感受，被人仰慕两眼放光的感受，被人崇拜欢呼的感受，被人铭记不断提起的感受，预期自己的成果超越个人存续时间产生影响的自豪感受。

So when deciding whether to do something or weighing its meaning and value, the ultimate question is: what feelings will this bring me? Anything else is not the final reality—it's just abstraction detached from the real.

因此，决定是否做一件事、思考一件事的意义和价值，最终的回归之处是思考事情会给我带来什么感受。除以此外，考虑其他方面都不是终极的现实，只是脱离现实的抽象。

The ultimate reality is that we have only flowing feelings and own nothing else. For example: I must earn money or I'll starve. Wanting to "stay alive" is abstract. Wanting the daily feeling of a full stomach—that's the ultimate reality.

终极的现实是，人只有流淌的感受，不拥有任何东西。比如我必须赚钱，否则我就饿死。此时你的念头是想活下去，这是抽象的，如果你想要每天都饱腹的感受，那就回归到了终极的现实。

Or: I want my ex to take me back—abstract. I want the feeling of that person laughing and talking with me often—that's reality.

再比如，我想要男朋友和我复合，这同样是抽象，如果说我想要那个人经常和我欢声笑语的感受，这就是回归到现实。

Or: I want to achieve great success—still abstract. I want to be surrounded and flattered at gatherings—that's concrete.

再比如，我想要功成名就，这仍是抽象，如果说我想要在朋友聚会时被人簇拥巴结，这是现实。

In short, a few kinds of feelings are worth pursuing in life.

概括来看，人生有几种感觉是值得追求的。

* **Calm**: no illness, no pain, no worries, no disasters, focused on what you're doing...
* **Pleasure**: listening to music, watching movies, soaking in hot springs, tasting good food...
* **Happiness**: warm family gatherings, loving time with a partner, easy talks with friends, being deeply understood in harmonious relationships...
* **Achievement**: finishing hard tasks, mastering skills, growing in understanding...

平静感：无病无痛，无忧无虑，无灾无难，专注做事情...... 

愉悦感：听音乐、看电影、泡温泉、品尝美食......

幸福感：与家人温馨相聚、与伴侣爱意相处、与朋友的畅快聊天，深处在和谐的被理解的人际关系之中......

成就感：完成艰难的任务，掌握技能，认知不断提升......

The opposites—anxiety, pain, loneliness, frustration, emptiness...

相反的感觉则是焦虑、痛苦、孤独、挫败、空虚......

Before, I often thought in abstract terms like value and meaning. They never gave me satisfying answers—why people throw themselves into things without looking back, what meaning or values really drive them.

在这之前，我常常用抽象的词汇思考，如价值、意义。用它们思考总是无法让我得到更深入的答案，比如人为什么会义无反顾地做一些事情，背后到底是寻求什么意义，或者是什么价值观在驱动。

Lately I've realized that abstract thinking with abstract words won't yield answers close to reality. So I've turned to language closer to the ground.

近来我已发现，用抽象的词作抽象的思考，就不会得到贴近实际的答案。于是，我转而寻求更贴近实际的语言。

That's how I arrived at feeling-ism. It's a good discovery.

这便是我找到感受主义的开端。这真是一个好发现。
