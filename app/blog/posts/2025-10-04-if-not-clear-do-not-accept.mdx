summary: "Induction is to find the rule; deduction is to test it. The mistake is accepting unverified principles. You entered the ring—accept its rules. Regret is meaningless; errors are inevitable. What matters is updating your system."
summary_zh: "归纳是为了找到法则，演绎是为了验证它。错误在于接纳未经检验的原则。已进入拳击场，就得接受它的规则。懊悔无意义，错误总难免。重要的是更新系统。"

The purpose of induction is to summarize the core principle. The purpose of deduction is to verify the core principle. The common mistake is inducing superficial features, rarely using deduction to verify the core principle, and accepting many unverified principles. Descartes' rule of thought was right: accept nothing that is not clear. The habit to cultivate is this: ask what core principle these things actually follow. Have I verified it myself?

归纳的目的是总结核心原则，演绎的目的是验证核心原则。常犯的错误是，归纳了表面特征，很少用演绎去验证核心原则，接受了很多未经验证的原则。笛卡尔的思考原则是对的，凡不清楚，不予接纳。应当养成的习惯是，追问这些事物到底遵循什么核心原则，我亲自验证了吗？

Lose boredom, and you get confusion. If you always have something you want to do, you won't be bored. Having something to do, you encounter obstacles to its realization. No matter what, in the end, everything arrives at meaninglessness. But the two are different. Boredom escapes meaninglessness. Confusion faces it head-on.

失去无聊，就会得到困惑。总是有想做的事情，就不会无聊，有了事情做，就会遇到实现的障碍。不管怎样，到头来一切抵达毫无意义。但二者所有不同，无聊逃避毫无意义，困惑直面毫无意义。

"The world is a slapdash affair." The people who say this are often spectators making sweeping comments, not the key players on stage creating results. When we step down to practice, we find that the difficulty of accomplishing something is relative—it varies from person to person, from task to task. A thing may be easy for others, hard for me, or hard for others, easy for me. Whether it's slapdash isn't important. If you want to get things done, you have to get on the table. Moreover, the drive to accomplish shouldn't be lured by the cognitive bias of "it's not hard, many people with little skill can do it well." It should come from your own desire to achieve. Confidence doesn't come from the outside, but from your own judgment and resolve.

“世界是草台班子”。说这话的人往往是旁观阔论的观众，不是舞台上缔造成果的重要角色。当我们下场实践就会发现，成事的难易是相对的，因人因事而异。一件事情，可能人易我难，或者人难我易。草台与否不重要，如果想成事，就要上牌桌。而且，成事的驱动力，不应该来自“不难的，很多人没啥水平也能做好”的认知偏差所蛊惑，而应该源自自身成事的渴望，信心不来自外部，而是自身的判断和坚定。

Marcus Aurelius had a saying. He said you can't complain in the boxing ring if a boxer hits you. I think my attitude toward life is like that—I've entered this arena, so I accept its rules: uncertainty, uneven distribution, absolute limits.

马可奥勒留有一个说法，他说在拳击场里面，你不能埋怨拳手打了你。我想我对生活的态度，就是如此——我进入了这个场域，就接受它的规则：不确定性，分布不均，绝对限制。

No mistake, however large, deserves regret. Observe life closely, and you'll see everything happens in accordance with laws. At that moment, you simply couldn't consider it. You simply wouldn't make a sufficiently correct choice. Regret is meaningless. What has happened is objective. If it's objective, accept it. The foolish person steps in the same hole again. The smarter one learns from the experience. The smart enough learn from others' mistakes to increase their own understanding. Errors are unavoidable. What matters is, after making a mistake, updating your decision-making system and your methods of execution.

犯再大的错误也不应该懊悔。仔细观察生活，就会发现一切都以合乎法则的方式发生着。在那时点，你就是考虑不到，你就是不会做出足够正确的选择。懊悔没有意义，已然发生就是客观，是客观就接受。愚蠢的人踩坑后还会再踩，聪明点则吃一堑长一智，足够聪明则以他人的错误来涨自身的认知。错误总归难免，重要的是犯错后，更新决策系统和执行方式。
