One of the beautiful things about deep feeling is the mutual, honest exposure of ourselves—the good and the bad, the visible and the hidden, the many-sided and contradictory—followed by acceptance of the real, imperfect other. Love begins with attraction. Casual acquaintance may produce surface appeal, but heartfelt admiration and acceptance can only arise when two people talk openly and deeply.

情感美妙的地方之一，在于相互坦诚暴露自身，好的坏的，可见人的不可见人，多面的矛盾的，以及对真实且不完美对方的接纳。爱情起源于吸引。泛泛而交可能会带来表面的吸引，但是来自内心的欣赏和接纳，只能产生于两个人坦诚深度的交流。

For a long time I didn't know what love was, or what people really meant when they talked about it. What is it? An emotional dependence? Acts of care and protection? Physical desire? Giving without expecting return? Respect and cherishing? Appreciation and liking? I'm not sure. Now I think the common ground among all these is the shadow of love.

很长一段时间，我不知道爱是什么，也不清楚当人们在谈论爱的时候，到底在谈论什么。它是什么呢？依赖的情感指向？呵护关怀的行为？生理结合的欲望？不求回报的给予？尊重和爱惜？欣赏和喜欢？我不确定，我现在倒是认为，上述的共同交集，就是爱的影子。

Become someone worth loving, and also someone who knows how to love others. Both will benefit you.

做一个值得被爱的人，还要做一个懂得爱他人的人。这两件事情都会令自身受益。

We often say: if only I'd chosen differently, if only I'd tried harder, if only luck had been a little better, my life wouldn't look like this now. But I'm coming to see that a person, right now, is exactly who they were meant to become.

我们常常会说，如果我当初选择什么，如果我当时再努力一点，如果那会运气再好一些，我现在的生活就不会是这个样子。而我越来发现，人，他现在的样子就是他本该成为的样子。

What matters isn't whether the tools are cutting-edge; it's whether you can solve problems that actually influence something. One mistake I've made is focusing too much on solutions instead of problems. Yuri Levin said to fall in love with the problem. That's far beyond my experience so far.

重要的不是工具先进与否，而是能否解决有影响力的问题。我犯下的一个错误就是过于关注解决方案，而是问题。尤里·莱文说，要爱上问题。这就远远超出我经验。

I don't want to waste my life—that wouldn't be a good accounting for my short time here. Nor do I want to stay trapped, whether in psychological or physical space, in ability or in thought. So these two things have become central to how I live: examining my own existence and striving to become smarter. It seems I'm not chasing something so much as pushing back—against emptiness, against imprisonment.

我不想虚度一生，这对自己短暂的人生不是好的交代。也不希望自己一直被困住，不管是心理空间还是物理空间，能力抑或思想。于是，这两件事成为了我生活的重要形式：思考自身存在，争取变更聪明。这似乎表明，我不是追求什么，而是反对——反虚无、反囚困。

Nietzsche's "will to power" has hung in my mind for five years. Only now do I begin to understand it. People pursue the will to power because they want to maximize their influence on the world—ideally to be remembered forever, to live on through history.

尼采的“权力意志”，在我心里悬挂了五年，直到现在才算有所理解。人追求权力意志，就是想最大化自身的社会影响力，最好名垂青史，永世长存。

As a bird, don't trust the branch—trust your own wings, starting from when they were still undeveloped.

作为一只鸟，不要相信树枝，要相信自己的翅膀，从羽翼未丰开始。
