### **Preface**
**自序**


At first, I wrote all this to become myself.

最初，我写下这一切，是为了成为我自己。

  

Writing isn’t a hobby for me. It’s not how I make a living. It’s not even a way to train my thinking. It’s more like a state of mind—one that makes me take life, and myself, seriously.

写作对我来说不是爱好，不是谋生，不是思维练习。它更像是一种状态，让我严肃地面对生活和自己。

  

I wrote down my feelings of inferiority, confusion, anger, and reflection. I wrote about my dislike for bald monks, and also my tenderness toward a cherry blossom. I wrote about how society tames people, how they fall apart, and how creativity can wither in spring. I wrote about the cracks in myself, not the polished version.

我写下自己的自卑、困惑、愤怒、沉思。我写下对秃驴的反感，也写我对一株樱花的怜惜。我写社会的驯化，写人的断裂，写创造力如何在春天枯死。我写“我”的裂缝，而不是“我”的完美。

  

I’m not a writer, and I’ll never be someone who makes a living from words. I write these pieces the same way I write in a diary. No imagined reader. No need to perform. Just me, writing for myself.

我不是作家，将来也不会成为以文字为生的人。我写这些文字，不过正如我写日记一样。没有预设读者，不必假装给谁看，除了我自己。

  

I call this book **Selfhood**.

我把这本书叫做《自我性》。

  

The name came from a suggestion by artificial intelligence. It read through my writing and concluded that “Selfhood” was a word I had coined. It’s rooted in my own way of thinking about individual existence—not as some abstract “self,” but as a spiritual core that grows, sees, and acts.

名字来自人工智能的建议。它通读了我的文字，认为“自我性”是我原创词汇，它直接源自我对个体存在的哲学思考，它不是抽象的“自我”泛谈，而是有成长性、觉察性、主动性的精神内核。

  

Selfhood is a process. It’s me peeling myself away from the roles I’ve played,

“自我性”是一个过程，是我从“角色”里剥离出“我”，

  

and separating my voice from the voices of the collective and society.

从集体和社会的声音中，分离出自己。

  

It’s less of a noun and more of a verb—a word that records the process of becoming who you are.

与其说它是一个名词，不如说它是一个动词，记录一个人成为他自己的历程。

### No.1 Quiet and Reserved, Like Falling Leaves and Flowing Water**

安静，沉敛，如落叶流水

In writing these scattered notes, I am quiet and calm, like falling leaves, like running water.

在写杂记里，我安静，沉敛，如落叶流水。

I speak softly about what I’ve been through, from east to west. I listen to myself with full attention. Each word matters. This is when I feel most real.

我低语述说经历，从东到西，自己会神地倾听，字字入心，这是我最有存在感的时刻。

To be watched by a crowd isn’t to exist. That’s noise and confusion. Poetry grows in peace.

万众瞩目不是存在，是嘈杂和混乱，诗意生长在和谐和安宁里。

  

When someone treats themselves seriously, poetry, spirit, and dignity emerge. A kind of beauty. A kind of strength. A kind of being.

人严肃对待自己，就会产生诗意、精神、尊严，一种美，一种力量，一种存在。

  

The universe is vast. The world is full of people. My life feels like dust. But because I live for myself, I begin to expand. My words flow like spring water. My listening is warm light. Life exists between water and light.

看这宇宙，那么浩瀚，这世界有那么多人，我这生活如尘埃。不过，我因自己而开始辽阔，我的倾述如涓涓春水，我的倾听似暖光，水与光之间是生机。

  

I am part of the universe in life, and part of it in death. Just one point in the infinite. But that point is eternal.

我生是宇宙的部分，死也是宇宙的部分，这部分是无限的一点，但也永恒。

  

Flip it around: maybe I’m just brain signals. My thoughts, my images, my illusions. Dust. A bug. A speck. Maybe nothing at all. Maybe I never existed.

反着来说，这不过是我神经元间的信号，我的意识，我的意象和幻念，我仍是尘埃、蝼蚁、浮游，或者什么狗屁也不是，灰飞烟灭后宛如不曾存在。

  

I believe all these almost-facts. But poetry is still poetry. Spirit is still spirit. Dignity is still dignity. I like facts. I also like good things. One of the best lessons I learned is how to hold contradictions in my head—and enjoy both.

我十足相信这些近乎事实的视角，而诗意就是诗意，精神就是精神，尊严就是尊严。我喜欢事实，也喜欢好事物。我受到最好的教育之一，就是把矛盾的事物融合在一个小脑瓜里，并享用二者。

  

When I’m just a walk-on in the play of life, I know one thing clearly: I’m the one who should take myself most seriously.

在生活里作路人甲的时候，我会很清晰地明白，自己应该是最能严肃对待我的人了。

  

And who am I? I’m the sum of what I think and what I do.

而我是谁，我是我的全部观念和行为的总和。

  

In Christianity, they speak of “cleansing.” I want to cleanse myself too.

基督教里常说“洁净”，我也想洁净自己。

  

I want to make more beauty, more poetry for myself.

我想为自己创造更多的诗意和美。

  

In a life that’s hot, messy, and raw, I want to plant better thoughts and do better things. I want to create something good.

我想在烈日、繁琐、带腥的生活里，多一些好观念好行为，创造一些好的东西。

  

I don’t like dreams. That’s the future. I like now.

我不喜欢梦想，那是未来，我喜欢现在。

  

To live right here, right now. Real from the outside in. Poetic from the inside out.

就活在此时此刻里，由外而内地现实，由内而外地诗意。

  

Carry sixpence, and look at the moon. If you mess something up, do it again.

揣着六便士看月亮，做不好的事情就再做一遍。

  

That’s all.

以上。

### **No.2 Jerry Took the Wrong Turn**

  No.2 杰瑞找错了路**

  

A little Jerry had slipped into Xiaolingzi’s room.

小灵子的房间跑进了一只小杰瑞。

  

It stared with shiny black eyes from the corner of the wardrobe. Its body wasn’t even hidden in shadow, and yet it vanished in the blink of an eye.

在衣柜拐角瞪着乌黑油亮的眼睛，身体则没在暗影里，不过一转眼就消失掉。

  

“There’s a mouse in my room!” she said, a bit startled, but also strangely amused. “I’ve never lived, slept, or cohabited with a mouse before!”

“我房间里进老鼠了！”惊吓里似乎带着些许新鲜，“我还没跟老鼠一起住过，睡过，生活过！”

  

And of course, there was some grievance. When had she ever been so wronged?

当然还有委屈，她什么时候受过这样的委屈？

  

In the days that followed, she got the full experience of living with Jerry.

接下来的几天，她充分体验了和杰瑞生活在一起的感觉。

  

Every night came with faint rustles, the sound of plastic bags being chewed.

夜里总有稀稀疏疏，塑料袋被撕咬的声音。

  

She slept in snatches, waking again and again; in the daytime, she pushed through drowsiness at the office.

晚上她睡一阵醒一阵，白天在办公室撑一阵困一阵。

  

To show due hospitality to Brother Jerry, I ordered some heavy-duty mouse traps and glue boards online.

为了照顾好杰瑞老弟，我网购了老鼠大夹子和粘鼠神贴。

  

I baited the traps with wheat flour, and the glue boards with leftover food. A proper feast.

老鼠夹子放些麦子粉，神贴上放点剩菜诱饵，盛情招待。

  

But Jerry, born in the South, seemed unimpressed by Northern cuisine.

似乎生于南方的杰瑞，不感冒北方的食物。

  

The bait was untouched. Even the trash can stayed upright.

食物一点没动，垃圾桶也不翻。

  

Either Jerry was picky or smart. Probably both.

这杰瑞老弟，不是挑剔就是聪明，我猜两者都有一些。

  

Days passed. Jerry kept chewing his plastic bags. Xiaolingzi kept losing sleep.

几天下来杰瑞还是咬它的塑料袋，小灵子还是失她的眠。

  

She sighed in frustration.

小灵子大为感叹，

  

She had stepped on her own traps multiple times.

她布下的老鼠夹，自己都踩了好几次，

  

Yet Jerry stayed unscathed, apparently smarter than she was.

而杰瑞老弟却是毫发无伤，简直比她还要聪明。

  

He reminded me of something. I used to believe in human exceptionalism.

杰瑞老弟不由令我想起，以前我是一个人类中心论者，

  

I didn’t realize I did, but I always assumed humans were special—conscious in ways lesser animals weren’t.

尽管不自知如此，但总认为人类是独特的，拥有其他低等生物所不具有的意识。

  

Then, in _The Green Planet_, I watched plants demonstrate survival strategies that looked like thought.

直到在《绿色星球》里，我观察到大量植物都有着自己的生存策略，

  

They responded to their environments, adapted their behavior, and evolved features to help them live.

仿佛都具有类似人类意识一样的东西——能够根据环境调整自身的行为，进化出有利于自身生存的部件和行为。

  

I was amazed by Jerry’s intelligence—almost like wisdom.

我惊叹杰瑞那近乎智慧的聪明。

  

And I began to think: maybe the difference between him and me isn’t consciousness versus none,

我还渐渐认为，杰瑞老弟和我的区别，并不是我有意识而它没有，

  

but complexity—more neurons, more intricate processing.

而是我拥有更多的神经元，能够产生更加复杂的意识活动，

  

Better hands, better tools, better language.

有更加便利的四肢和手指、更好的社会环境，

  

I can read, write, reflect, flirt.

能够识字、写文章、记录思考，能说些甜言蜜语，和异性打情骂俏。

  

If consciousness isn’t unique to humans, then intelligence—its crystallization—might not be either.

如果意识不为人类独有，那么作为意识的结晶——智慧，也不为人类独有。

  

Maybe consciousness belongs not to humans, but to life.

也许意识，可能是生命所独有，

  

And humans are only one kind of life.

而人类只是一种生命形态。

  

One day, Xiaolingzi found some long-forgotten Sachima under the bed.

这天，小灵子发现床下遗忘已久的沙琪玛，

  

Jerry had eaten four packs.

已经被杰瑞吃掉四包。

  

The wrappers were empty. Not a crumb left.

包装袋空空如也，里面的沙琪玛吃干抹净。

  

As a top predator—Tom, naturally—I had to step in.

作为顶级捕猎手的汤姆，我终究还是下场了。

  

I planned from a distance: don’t throw away the remaining Sachima—use it as bait.

我这样远程布局：剩下的沙琪玛不要丢，就当做诱饵，

Clearly, Jerry had a sweet tooth.

显然杰瑞老弟很喜欢甜点。

  

I deployed all the mouse traps, pulled out the glue boards.

老鼠夹都用上，神贴都拿出来。

  

Put the Sachima in the center of a glue board, and placed it back under the bed where he’d found it before.

沙琪玛搁在神贴中央，放回床底原来的位置，

  

Then added two big traps beside it.

再放两个大夹子。

  

I was sure—he’d tasted sweetness there, and he’d come back.

我笃定，它在那里尝到甜头，就一定会重返那儿，

  

Humans do. Animals do.

人如此，动物亦如此，

  

It’s coded into the genes of life.

这是刻在生命基因里的规则。

  

To add one more line of defense, I told her to leave the door ajar.

为了再增加一道防线，我让她留一条门缝，

  

In the gap, a big trap. On both sides, a glue board—easy entrance and exit.

缝间堵着一个大夹子，前后各铺一张神贴，方便杰瑞老弟进出。

  

Also prepped a bag. As soon as we caught him, we’d bag him and take him out.

再准备一个袋子，逮着就包起来拎出去。

  

The setup was thorough. The result, satisfying.

准备很充分，结果也很满意。

  

At 5 a.m., Jerry crossed the first line—

凌晨五点，杰瑞跨过了我的第一道防线，

  

the trap at the door was triggered but didn’t catch him.

门缝的夹子被触发了但没咬住它，

  

The glue boards, untouched.

而且前后的贴纸一点都没走样。

  

But when he reached his land of sweetness,

而当它吭哧吭哧抵达甜蜜乡，

  

_Snap_—the trap caught him by the neck.

“吱”一声，夹子咬住了它的脖子。

  

He’d returned to where he’d once tasted pleasure.

它终究还是回到了尝到甜头的地方。

  

Shenzhen has a lot of people.

深圳人很多，

  

Where there are people, there’s trash.

人多垃圾就多，

  

Where there’s trash, there’s Jerry.

杰瑞们自然少不了。

  

There have been four major plagues in human history.

人类历史上有四次大鼠疫，

  

The first was at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty.

第一次是东汉末年，

  

The second and third killed 50 million people.

第二和第三次弄死了五千万人，

  

The most recent was last century—12 million dead.

最近一次是上个世纪，死了一千两百多万人。

  

Clearly, Jerrys are practically avatars of plague.

可见杰瑞们简直是瘟疫的化身，

  

Modern society can’t allow them to stroll the streets or waltz into homes.

现代社会不能容忍它们招摇上街和登堂入室，

  

But still, I know—they are products of evolution,

但是我又知道，这是自然界进化的产物，

  

another expression of life.

这是生命的另一种形态。

  

At the species level, Jerry and I can’t coexist.

在物种层面，我和杰瑞不能同处，

  

But at the level of life—we are kin.

但在生命层面，我们又同源共生。

  

I once saw a sharp comment on _Blue Planet II_.

关于生命，我在《蓝色星球 2》看到一句精辟的弹幕，

  

It said: “Life always finds a way.”

它说“生命总会找到出路”。

  

The BBC nature docs prove this perfectly:

BBC 系列的自然纪录片，真是完美地诠释着这句话：

  

plants growing in wall cracks,

墙缝里的植物，

  

dry grass surviving the desert,

沙漠里的枯草，

  

tiny fish enduring tons of pressure in the deep sea,

深海承受几十吨水压的小鱼，

  

a hawkfish laying eggs beneath a shark’s jaw.

在鲨鱼嘴底下产卵的革鳞鮨（yi 第四声）。

  

And of course—humans too.

当然，人类也是典型体现。

  

Zoologists say mice have been around for over 40 million years.

动物学说，老鼠有四千多万年的历史，

  

Much longer than humans.

这比人类的历史要长得多。

  

It proves this species has always found ways to survive.

也足以说明在漫长的演化进程中，这个物种，一直在寻找出路。

  

One even found its way into Xiaolingzi’s room—

这不，有一只就找到小灵子房间来，

  

though it took the wrong turn.

虽然找错了。

  

It’s not just Jerry that stirs these thoughts in me.

不是杰瑞现在才让我有感而发，

  

I walk through life—into society, history, nature,

我走进生活，走进社会、历史、自然，

  

into my inner world, and into the worlds of others—

走进自己的内心、他人的世界，

  

encountering all sorts of life forms.

接触形形色色的生命形态，

  

But still, I’m puzzled.

但是常有困惑。

  

I can understand why species can’t share space,

我能理解生命里，物种生存空间的不兼容

  

why they deceive and kill each other.

和尔虞我诈、相互残杀，

  

But I don’t understand life itself.

但我不理解生命。

  

I can understand life as a series of nodes in the evolution of the universe—

我能理解，生命是宇宙演化的一串节点，

  

me as one node, Jerry another—

我是节点中的节点，杰瑞也是，

  

but I still don’t understand life.

但我不理解生命。

  

I don’t know where its force comes from.

我不理解生命的力量从何而来，

  

Why it always seeks a way.

生命为何总在寻找出路，

  

What the force to live actually means.

生的力量意味着什么。

Later, Xiaolingzi got up early, took Jerry outside in a bag, and went back to bed.

后来呢，小灵子一大早起来把杰瑞老弟拎出去，又回来睡回笼觉。

  

I asked her if Jerry got to eat the Sachima.

我问她杰瑞有没有吃到沙琪玛，

  

She said no.

她说没有。

  

That felt like a bit of a pity.

这就有些遗憾，

  

As a “Tom” myself, though a top hunter, I’m not cold-blooded.

我这头“汤姆”，只是顶级而不是冷血，

  

I would’ve preferred he left this world with a full belly.

我倒是希望它吃饱了上路的。

### **No.3 Herding Cattle and Being**
**No.3 放牛与存在**

  

When I was little, I herded cattle.

小时候放牛，

  

Caked chunks of gray mud clung to the cow’s hide.

牛身上硬结灰色的泥块，

  

I fell asleep to the smell of muddy ditches on her body.

我闻着她浑身一股河沟的臭味睡了过去。

  

Suddenly, she dropped her front legs, kicked out her hind legs, and threw me to the ground.

她忽然前腿一跪，后腿一挺，将我掀倒在地。

  

I jolted awake just as she raised her leg, aiming it squarely at my soft belly.

我猛地醒来，只见她抬起腿，对准我薄嫩的肚皮。

  

I was not yet ten. A single kick would’ve torn me open.

我十岁不到，那一脚下去必定是穿肠破肚。

  

But at that instant, it was as if she recognized me—

刹那间，她似乎又看清了我，

  

and begrudgingly walked away.

悻悻地走掉。

  

I used to be afraid she’d toss me onto the roof with her horns—

以前我总是害怕她一头牛角把我送上屋顶，

  

leave me there, butt in the air, like a broken flower.

让我撅着破烂的屁股朝天盛开。

  

But no matter what, she never hurt me.

但不管如何，她从没伤害过我。

  

Later, when I went off to school, she was sold.

后来我上学，她被卖掉了。

  

If souls do reincarnate,

如果有灵魂转世，

  

I don’t know what kind of soul might’ve been trapped inside that cow.

我不知道是什么样的灵魂困在这头牛身上。

  

There was an old longan tree at the village entrance—no one remembered who had planted it.

村头有一棵老龙眼，不知谁人何时所植，

  

An old granny used to sit beneath it, spanning two centuries,

树下常坐一位老奶，从上世纪跨到本世纪，

  

living through nearly a hundred years—until she finally fell asleep there forever.

经历近百年的沧桑，最后在树下永远沉睡。

  

Strangely, after she died, the old longan tree withered too.

她死了以后，也是神奇，老龙眼也枯萎掉。

  

In _One Hundred Years of Solitude_, Melquíades says,

《百年孤独》里，梅尔基亚德斯说，

  

“All things have a spirit. You just have to awaken it.”

“万物皆有灵，只需要唤醒它们的灵性。”

  

I don’t know if that’s true.

我不知道是否如此，

  

But I know this: wolves can nurse their pups tenderly,

我知道的是狼会柔情哺乳，

  

and they can also kill without mercy.

也会嗜血猎杀，

  

The world runs by its own laws.

世界以其自在法则运行着。

  

I don’t understand existence. I can’t fathom its laws.

我搞不懂存在，参悟不透它的法则。

  

All I know is this:

只知道那天，

  

I was herding cattle in the fields.

我在田里放牛，

  

The cow slept in the grass,

牛趴草地上睡，

  

I dozed on her back.

我骑牛背上打盹，

  

Shade covered us both.

树荫罩着我俩，

  

A white wind drifted above the shade, from west to east.

白色的风在树荫上空，由西往东，

  

It swept through like the heavens were moving house.

浩浩荡荡如天庭搬家，

  

I’ve never seen so many clouds in my life.

我一辈子没见过这么多云。

  

**June 7, 2023 — Jinhe Bay**

**二零二三年六月七日，金河湾**

### **No.4 My Dear Creativity**

   **No.4 我亲爱的创造力**

  

It’s already spring. Grass grows, flowers bloom. Boars mount sows in the name of love.

已是春天，草长花开，公猪骑上母猪开始恩爱。

  

But my creativity withers day by day, drooping like a sunflower whose roots have rotted.

然而，我的创造力一天天萎靡，耷拉得像烂了根的向日葵。

  

When Wallace reached middle age, he wrapped a rope around his neck and ended his forty-six years.

华莱士中年时，往脖子套上绳，挂掉他四十六年的一生。

  

He once said: life is like water, and people are fish. Don’t forget what water is.

是他说生活如水，人就是鱼，别忘了水是什么。

  

I heard that in my teens and remembered it for years.

我十多岁听来这个提醒，往后多年谨记于心。

  

But the more I look, the more I see: the water is murky. And hard to love.

只是越发看到，这水很浑浊，令人生厌。

  

I don’t have Wallace’s courage to die.

我没有华莱士赴死的勇气，

  

There’s still so much I care about. So many longings.

尚有很多牵挂和渴望，

  

And sometimes, in brief flashes, I still get the urge to live.

还能间歇性地勃起生活的欲望。

  

But desire isn’t a miracle drug.

但欲望不是神药，

  

And life can’t always move forward in a state of full arousal.

生活也无法承受永远充血行进之重。

  

My creativity is dead.

我的创造力死了，

  

It died even earlier than Wallace did—collapsed in spring, before it ever got to bloom.

比华莱士死得还早，还没开花就倒在春天里。

  

I look up, and between the sunlight and the struggle, I see clouds floating freely—me, but not me.

我抬起头，在阳光和苦难之间，看见白云悠然，似我非我。

  

I don’t feel pain. I feel peace.

我没有痛苦，而是平和，

  

The peace of a flower bud falling silently into the slow current of time.

平和如花苞掉落在悄悄的时间流水上。

  

I think, I’ll be dead for a long time.

我就想，我会死去很久，

  

Sinking to the bottom of time’s river.

彻底沉在时间的河底，

  

No need to hurry.

不必这么着急沉下去。

  

At least, open my chest once more. And say this: Fuck.

至少先敞开胸怀，提上一句：草。

### **No.5 Most People Live in Mediocrity**
**No.5 大多数人庸庸碌碌**


There’s a concept in statistics called the bell curve.

统计学上有一个分布类型，叫钟型分布。

  

It means most samples cluster in the middle, with a few trailing off at either end.

就是大多数样本处在中间，少数掉尾巴，少数排前头。

  

Human achievement follows this shape.

人类的整体成就概况就是符合这个钟型结构。

  

So what does it mean that most people live a mediocre life and achieve nothing big?

大多数人庸庸碌碌一生，一事无成的本质是什么 ？

  

It means they’re under the curse of the bell curve.

本质就是这个钟型结构的诅咒。

  

First, when you’re born, chances are high you land in the middle—

首先，投胎降生的时候，人大概率就会落在中间位置，

  

because the middle is the biggest zone.

因这个区域极大。

  

People in this range aren’t born rich, brilliant, or stunning.

这个区域的特征就是，没有含着金钥匙、极高的天赋、美若潘安。

  

Second, this structure is fluid. Even if you work hard, others do too.

其次是，这个结构是流动的，即便你努力，别人也会努力的。

  

Part of that movement is collective:

这种流动性，一部分是整体移动，

  

everyone levels up, so your relative position doesn’t change.

中间个体的相对位置没变。

  

Say everyone goes from broke to ten thousand, then to a hundred thousand.

具体说大家都从一穷二白变成万元户，再变成十万元，百万元户，

  

Then you’re still average.

那么你仍旧是平平无奇。

  

What you worked hard to achieve, others did too.

你努力做到的事情，大家也在努力做，

  

If you can do it, so can others—

你能做到，别人也可以，

  

which means you’re still “nothing special.”

因此就显得还是“一事无成”，

  

Because what we call success is usually a comparison.

因为我们所说的有成，往往是比较概念。

  

Then there’s localized movement:

另一部分的流动性，是局部的，

  

You only stand out if you do something most people can’t.

只有当你做到，大多数都做不到的事，

  

That’s how you break into the top.

你才开始崭露头角，才有机会跻身到前排，备受瞩目。

  

But this kind of leap isn’t just about effort.

但局部的流动性，很多人都在想。不仅仅是你个人努力就可以，

  

It needs talent, luck, connections, timing—

这里面还需要先天条件、运气、身边资源、外部趋势，

  

and other things you can’t fully control.

等等各种并非你所能很好控制的要素。

  

Now let’s take a step back.

现在，我们退一步看看这种钟型结构的视角。

  

This model reflects an elite way of seeing.

整体上看，这是一种精英视角，

  

Everyone wants the spotlight,

人人都想万众瞩目，

  

to be rich, powerful, admired, remembered.

富甲一方，出人头地，光宗耀祖，名留青史。

  

Everyone watches the stage,

人人都盯着舞台，

  

hoping to stand in the light.

想登上去，站在聚光灯下一展风采，

  

But the ones who make it are few.

但能做到的人，往往都是少数，

  

Most people are the audience.

大多数人都是围观的群众，作台下的观众。

  

So—what other perspectives can we try?

因此，除了这个视角，我们还可以有什么视角呢？

  

We can focus on living well, from a normal human point of view.

就是过好自己的生活，回归个人平民视角，

  

Drop the elite lens imposed by school and society.

摆脱教育和社会环境下普遍存在的精英视角。

  

We can quiet down, pay less attention to the outside world.

可以静下心来，少点关注外面的世界，

  

Don’t worry whether you’ve “made it.”

不用理会是不是一事无成，

  

Focus on your life:

关注自己的生活，

  

Find a job to support yourself.

找一份工作先养活自己，

  

Take care of your body. Eat fewer takeout meals.

照顾好身体，少吃外卖，

  

If fate allows, find a partner.

有机缘就与另一个人皆为伴侣，

  

Build intimacy. Enjoy the beauty of it.

经营亲密关系，享受其中的美妙。

  

If you have the ability, raise a family.

如果有能力，那去成立家庭。

  

Then you’ll realize:

不过这个时候，人会发现

  

being able to support a family for decades is no small feat.

能靠自己能力，养活一个家庭几十年，就是一件了不起的事情，

  

You’ll stop looking down on ordinary parents.

再也不会看不起庸庸碌碌的一些普通父母，普通的人。

  

Can’t afford a house? Don’t buy one.

另外，买不起房就不要买，

  

Don’t start a capital-heavy business.
