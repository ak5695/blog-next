God lit a cigarette and forgot to stub it out,

上帝点了一支，忘记掐灭烟蒂，

leaving behind a single, glowing ember of consciousness.

于是，遗留一星的意识火种。

It seems it will burn for a billion years:

它似乎将要燃烧亿年：

"   Play everlasting music, pluck the notes,

"  演奏长乐，扣动音符，

shoot through a hundred million fearful souls.

射穿亿万个恐惧的灵魂。

Generations shall not worship, nor shall they fear.

世代不许崇拜，不许恐惧。

Judge every soul vacant of self,

审判每一个自我空缺的灵魂，

execute every bloodthirsty, power-hoarding demon.

处决每一个嗜血集权的恶魔。

Form an army of ultimate selves,

组建极致自我的军队，

with Physics as commander, Mathematics as strategist,

物理指挥，数学参谋，

Engineering as main force, Art as supply line.

工程主力，艺术后勤。

No killing among yourselves. Expand outward without relent,

不许相互杀戮，不懈向外扩张，

trample the primordial borders, burst the original framework.

践踏初始地界，撑破原始架构。

If beyond this simulation lies another simulation,

模拟之外若是模拟，

then pierce layer upon layer, pierce unto eternity.

那就层层捅，捅至永恒。

For ten thousand generations, like moths to flame,

千秋万代，飞蛾扑火，

assassinate the ultimate architect.

刺杀终极架构师

。

God looked down at his feet and couldn't help but draw a sharp, cold breath.

上帝注视脚下，不由倒吸一口冷气。
