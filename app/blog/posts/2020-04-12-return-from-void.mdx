summary: In the void, smash every perceived meaning—from comfort to glory, from truth to eternity. What remains is the unextinguishable fire of life's will, the simple, raw 'I want.' That alone is our anchor.

Go back to the void, and take back what belongs to us. Smash every meaning. Smash it to dust.

去！去虚无中拿回我们的东西。砸掉一切意义，砸个稀巴烂。

We must discard everything that claims to anchor existence:

* **Personal Security:** Safety, health, and comfort.
    从安全，健康到舒适，

* **Emotional & Social Bonds:** Friendship, love, and family; social approval and self-actualization.
    从友情，爱情到亲情，从社会认可到自我实现，通通砸掉，一个不剩。

* **Material & Abstract Value:** Money, power, and glory; truth, beauty, and the supreme good.
    什么金钱、权力、荣耀，什么真理、美好、至善，

* **Transcendent Ideals:** Heaven, eternity, and immortality. Burn them all, erase them to nothing.
    什么极乐、永生、不朽，全部烧掉，毁灭干净。

Overturn every existing meaning. Clear everything, leave not a single ash. Only the pure void. Return to the absolute emptiness—silent, cold, and bare.

推翻存在的一切意义，清空所有，不留一点灰烬，只要彻底的虚无，回到绝对虚无、孤寂、凄冷的原空。

### The Fire of Will

And then—don’t open your eyes. Listen. Listen for the crackling sound, the voice that says, "I know none of this means anything, but I want..."

这时不要睁开眼，而是听，听那噼里啪啦，听那声音说，“我知道这一切都没有任何意义，但是我想要……”

My dear, that is the **fire of life**—the one thing the void cannot extinguish. A flower blooming in the wilderness. Now open your eyes, and return with it.

亲爱的，这就是生命之火，虚无无法湮灭之物，旷野里的花。睁开眼，带着它重返生活。

I know that what I do, what I pursue, and what I achieve is all meaningless.

我知道所做、所追求和将会实现的，全都无意义，

But I still want:

* To see the red sun rise, to watch petals fall and waters flow.
    但我就是想要看红日初升，看花落水流，

* Noodles—the fullness rising from my stomach.
    就是想要拌面，从腹部而出的富足，

* To love—sincerely, wholly—from birth to death.
    就是想要爱，发自内心、真诚的爱，从生到死，

* The freedom and dignity of being human—to live with fish, to roam with birds.
    就是想要生而为人的自由与尊严，与鱼为伴，和鸟作群，

* And even at the end of the road, I’ll light a cigarette—as a salute, and as a funeral rite, to myself.
    即便山穷水尽也要点上一根烟，致敬乃祭奠自我。

In the vast void, the flame of life's will is faint and fragile. But it is all we have. And we must tell ourselves a thousand times:

在苍茫的虚无里，生命意志之火微弱无比。但它就是我们的一切了。我们要千万遍地告诉自己，

"None of this means anything, but I want this. I choose this."

“这一切都没有意义，但我就是要如此。”
