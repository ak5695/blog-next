I think I'm already very happy, within this emotional connection.

我想，我已经很幸福了，在这份情感联结之中。

How do I describe this sense of enough?

我该如何描述这份知足呢？

I first felt the stirrings of affection in my teens, craving union with another. For twenty years, I've walked into my own world, stepped into others' hearts, observed how people get along. I always see the loneliness. The natural bubble that encases each person.

我十来岁萌生情愫，渴望与他人结合。二十年来，我走进自己的世界，踏入别人的内心，观察人与人的相处。我总能看到孤独，天然罩在人身上的气泡。

It can be large or small. Differences in nature, knowledge, experience, ambition, status, interest, preference—each divergence props up this bubble. In life, even with the most familiar person, if you pull them out and place them before you, you can feel with extreme clarity the unbridgeable distance between you.

可大可小，天性、学识、阅历、志向、地位、利益、偏好，林林总总每一处的差异，支棱着这气泡。生活中，哪怕最熟悉的人，拎他出来放你面前，便能极其具象地感知到彼此之间无法排挤的距离。

This bubble is eternal, unbreakable. The day I realized this, I was twenty-seven, ending a four-year first love. I wasn't disappointed. I was relieved. It explained the contradictions, conflicts, the desire to be close yet the inability to merge that I'd observed in relationships. It is both the distance people want to eliminate and the defense they erect.

这气泡永恒不破。意识到这点的那天，我二十七岁，结束一段四年的初恋。我没有失望，反而舒畅了，它解释了我在人际里所体察到的矛盾、冲突、渴望靠近又无法相容。它既是人们想消除的距离，又是人们所竖立的防御。

In this world, everyone is isolated in their own camp. And now, there is actually such a person. One who opens herself without defense, pulls you into her arms, accepts you, to a degree that even surpasses your acceptance of yourself. Kisses you, over and over. Even a hundred miles apart, she kisses you on the screen. Unabashedly shows her fondness and attachment to you. Gives herself to you.

世界里，人人孤立为营。如今，竟然有这样一个人，毫无防备地敞开自己，将你拥入怀中，接纳你，其程度甚至超越你对自己。亲吻，一遍又一遍地吻你，即便相隔百里，也要亲上屏幕中的你，毫不遮掩地袒露对你的喜欢和依恋，委身于你。

The bubble hasn't vanished. Differences aren't erased. Conflict still happens. Standing inside loneliness, outside loneliness, I genuinely believe from the heart: this is already good enough. If I achieve anything in this life, this love is certainly the first thing I've done most successfully.

气泡没有消失，差异尚未消除，冲突依旧发生。站在孤独里、孤独外，我均发自内心地认为，这已然足够好了。倘若这辈子我能有什么成就，这爱情肯定是我此生首次做得最成功的一件事。

Maybe some accident will happen in the future, shattering my satisfaction, trampling our feelings with human nature or reality—life is usually like that. But this night-blooming flower truly blossomed for me. In this boundless dark night, in my fleeting life, emitting a faint white light.

也许将来会有什么意外，砸碎我的满意，以人性以现实，践踏我们的情感——生活通常如此。但这昙花，真真切切地为我盛开了，于这无边无际的黑夜里，在我转瞬即逝的生命中，泛着微微的白光。

The best thing she gets from me is an attachment imbued with acceptance, safety, understanding.

她从我这得到最好的事物，是蕴含着接纳、安全、理解的依恋。

The best thing I get from her is also attachment. It means intimacy. It means many messages a day, many emojis, many video calls. It means someone calls me sweetheart, sweetheart this, sweetheart that. "What are you doing, sweetheart?" "Sweetheart, chat with me for a bit." "Sweetheart, cuddle." "Sweetheart, do you know how much I like you?"

我从她那得到最好的，也是依恋。它意味着亲密，意味着一天好多条消息，好多个表情包，好多个视频通话。意味着有人叫我甜心，甜心前甜心后，“甜心在干嘛”，“甜心，和我聊会天嘛”，“甜心，贴贴”，“甜心，你知道我好喜欢你吗”。

Even though I'm emotionally independent and don't strictly *need* a relationship to live, I truly feel the beauty of attachment. It absolutely falls into the category of life's best experiences.

尽管情感独立，并不十分需要关系才能生活，然而我切实觉得依恋的美妙，绝对能划入人生最佳体验范畴之内。

But some people can't stand attachment, being clung to. If it's for focus, that's understandable. If the other party implies control and possession, that's also comprehensible. What's regrettable is how many unsettled hearts engage in immature relationships, hurt by immature emotions, unable to taste the rare, exquisite beauty found in attachment.

不过有人可受不了依恋、被粘着。若出于专注，这情有可原，若对方隐含控制与占有，也可以理解。令人遗憾的是，有多少心性未定的人谈着不成熟的恋爱，被不成熟的情感所伤，没法从依恋中品味到那爱情罕有的美妙。

Good love has always required a mature heart and one-on-one focus. Sometimes growing older has this benefit: it lets you appreciate some good things you couldn't understand when young.

好的爱情，一向需要成熟的心性、一对一的专注。有时候年纪增长就有这样的好处，令人能品味到一些年轻时无法理解到的好事物。

But having said that, many times when she kisses me, I zone out. As if my soul takes a step back, astonished: How can she kiss me so intently? It's incredible!

不过话说回来，很多次她亲吻的时候，我出戏了。仿佛灵魂向后退一步，诧异道：她怎么这么投入地吻我呢？简直不可思议！

And then I see her, dazzling, gentle, and charming. Ah, this is too good.

又见她扑朔迷离、温柔而妩媚。哎，这也太好了吧。

Return to my senses. Kiss her back.

回魂，吻她。
