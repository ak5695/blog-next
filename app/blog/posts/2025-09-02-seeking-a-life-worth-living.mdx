I don't write about things outside my experience, things I haven't practiced. I don't write clickbait for eyeballs either—and honestly, I don't know how to grab attention and generate traffic.

我不写经验之外、未经实践的内容，也不写博眼球的流量文字——也确实不知道如何吸睛赚取流量。

In the age of the attention economy, countless smart minds are figuring out how to market, how to become known to all. Among them was my former self. I've now abandoned that "broad and easy road."

在眼球经济时代，无数聪明头脑在琢磨如何营销、如何人尽皆知。那其中就有曾经的我，如今我放弃了这条“康庄大道”。

I'm unwilling to waste my limited time on fleeting trends or empty curiosities. This isn't disdain for those who work with traffic; the effort to survive is worthy of respect.

我不愿将有限的时间浪费在转瞬即逝的热点或满足猎奇的空洞上。并非鄙夷流量从业者，为生存的努力都值得尊重。

I've come to understand that some money isn't for me to earn, some meals aren't for me to eat. I too once racked my brains fantasizing about overnight fame. Through step-by-step practice, examination, and listening to myself, I turned back onto this "narrow path"—the one that fits me.

我渐渐明白，有些钱不适合我赚，有些饭不适合我吃。我曾经也绞尽脑汁幻想一夜爆火，在一步步实践、审视、自我倾听中，折回了现在这条“窄路”，适合自己的道路。

The content here falls mainly into two categories, often mixed together.

本公众号的内容，主要是分两类，它们往往混在一起。

The first is recording insights from life. An unexamined life is a passing glance, is carpe diem without reflection. I sometimes wonder about the people who have passed away around me: were they satisfied with their lives?

一类是记录生活中的体悟。未经审视的生活，是走马观花，是今朝有酒今朝醉。我偶尔会想，身边已逝去的人，他们是否满意自己的一生？

I want to live as consciously as possible. To know where I am and where I want to go. To understand what is actually happening in life. Is the tree moving, or am I moving? What do I feel in the scent of flowers and the flow of water? To give answers while still alive.

我希望尽可能有意识地生活，知道自己在哪想去哪，理解生活到底发生了什么，是树在动还是我在动，我在花香和流水里感受到了什么——在活着时，就给出回答。

To look back later and retrace the path through words. To understand the fact of existence itself more deeply by integrating the coming and going.

将来回顾过去，于文字中重温来时的路。在整合来去之间，更深入理解生命存在本身。

A person should speak views they deeply hold, share content from profound practice, not regurgitate others' wisdom or chatter about trivial irrelevancies. Not that they can't, but why spend this one and only life largely on the shallow and repetitive?

人应该说他深以为然的观点，分享深刻实践的内容，而不是拾人牙慧，或者谈论一些无关要紧的琐事。不是不能，而是何必将仅此一生大都投放在浅薄和重复之中？

The other category of content is self-education.

另外一类内容，是自我教育。

There is a type of adult, hard to estimate in number. Their achievements are few, yet they relish using impractical principles to guide the young, repeatedly reciting their limited practice and biased understanding, misleading their disciples.
Very unfortunately, I am among them. A friend once suggested I get a teaching qualification. That would undoubtedly be retreating from society back into the ivory tower, using my own lack of worldly experience to teach another group of inexperienced children.
Many teachers are like this. I was trapped by this educational system for years, and I have even less desire to be a know-it-all.
Some of my writing has a strong lecturing tone. Please don't misunderstand, reader. The person being educated is not someone else. It's me. In this world, the person I most want to change is myself.
有一类成年人，数量难估。他们成果屈指可数，偏偏喜好拿一些做不到的道理指导晚辈，一遍遍复述有限的实践和偏颇的认知，误人子弟。
非常不幸，这其中也有我。曾经有朋友建议我去考教资，那无疑是刚进社会就退回象牙塔，以涉世未深去教导另一群涉世未深的孩子。
很多老师便是如此。我本受此教育体系所困多年，也更不想好为人师。
我有些文字说教味较重，请读者不要误解。那教育的对象不是别人，而是我。这世界上，我最想改变的人是我自己。
In summary, both types of content are written for myself. They reflect the process of how I want to live deeply and shape myself.

总而言之，这两类内容，都是为自己而写，它们体现了我想要深度生活和自我塑造的过程。

Last week, a forty-year-old man, eyes red, told me: I'm a brand manager at a big company now. But you know what? In this society, I'm a nobody. I'm a loser.
生活把他数次逼上天台，一次次怂恿他纵身一跃。我们相隔不到十五公分，几乎能感受到他绝望的呼吸，却未感诧异。
Life had driven him to the rooftop edge several times, each time coaxing him to jump. We were less than fifteen centimeters apart; I could almost feel his breath of despair. I wasn't surprised.
毕竟生活的困境，大大小小总是不容易，区别是如何看待高墙，以及如何在里面生活。
Life's difficulties, big and small, are never easy. The difference lies in how you view the wall, and how you live inside it.

I'm not worried about the future getting better or worse. It's not up to me to worry anyway; events always unfold according to their own laws.

未来是变好变坏，我不担心，也由不得我担心，事件总是以合乎法则的方式发生着。

What I worry about is no longer understanding myself, not hearing its voice amid the cars and the crowds. That voice is the only vessel through which I exist and find happiness.

我担心的是不再理解自己，在车来人来中听不到它的声音。它可是我得以存在、得以幸福的唯一载体呀。

I used to think that things written for myself didn't need to be published on social media.

以前我认为，写给自己的东西，没必要发布在社交媒体上。

I'm slowly coming to understand that perfecting oneself and inspiring others are different paths to the same end:

我慢慢理解，完善自己与启发他人，殊途同归：

Both are answering—how to live a life that feels "worth it."

都在回答——该如何过上一种“值得”的生活。
