I hate fear. Whenever it shows up, I get angry.

我讨厌恐惧，每当恐惧的时候，我就感到愤怒。

Where's the nourishment in a garbage life? Skill training, meta-ability growth, soul sharpening. And in a non-garbage life? Exactly the same.

垃圾生活的养分在哪？在于技能训练、元能力提升、心灵磨砺。 非垃圾生活的养分在哪？也一样。

In beautiful relationships there is no "should." "Should" is the source of pain in relationships. He should care about me, I should get support. When it's not met, anger and distress follow. Look for people who give willingly, not people who give only after you demand it.

美妙的关系里，没有“应该”。应该，是关系中的痛苦源头。他应该关心我，我应该得到支持。这并不总能满足，于是愤怒、苦恼。找愿意主动给予的人，而不是要求之后给予的人。

Awareness of existence, fascination with wisdom, pity for suffering, disgust at imprisonment. I always forget these.

对存在的感知，对智慧的迷恋，对苦难的怜悯，对囚困的厌恶。我总是忘记这些。

The self has no fixed shape; it's more like a liquid. At first it takes the form of whatever container it's poured into. One day it changes state and bursts the container.

自我没有形状，更像一种液体。最初，装在不同造型的容器，就呈现不同形状。直到有一天改变状态，撑破了容器。

It's crucial to copy a gourd and get a model running first—however garbage, crude, or uncomprehending it is. Run it, then understand why it runs, then try to improve it. Understanding what makes it run is understanding the effective information. The reverse—stockpiling scattered knowledge first and only later seeking to run something—is inefficient.

依葫芦画瓢跑通模型很关键，非常垃圾、非常粗糙、完全不理解都可以。先跑通，再理解为何能跑通，再尝试完善。理解跑通，就是理解有效的信息。反过来，先学习储备一堆零散的知识，再寻求跑通，是低效的。

Deeply live "in the present" and you'll grow tired of repetition, so you'll crave progress. In chasing progress you'll forget the present again. Only when you fuse the two contradictions into one way of living do you find peace.

深入体会“活在当下”，会厌倦重复，于是渴望前进。在寻求前进里，又会忘记当下。直到将矛盾的二者，融合在一种生活方式里，才有安定。

Don't chase happiness; just stay out of pain. Pursuing happiness often brings pain, because sustained happiness is unbearably heavy and inevitably hits diminishing returns. Staying not-in-pain is far easier.

不追求快乐，而是保持不痛苦。追逐快乐，往往就痛苦，因为持续快乐具有不可承受之重，难逃体验边际递减。相比之下，保持不痛苦容易多了。
