summary: We don't need anyone else's love or belonging to live well—what we need is our own. Real home is wherever you happen to be, and life keeps going not because it's always good, but because the drive to grow is built into us.

We don't need love or belonging from others to live well. What we need is love we give ourselves. True home is wherever you are.


我们不需要他人的爱和归宿才能活得好。我们需要的是给自己的爱。真正的归宿是人在哪，归宿就在哪。

Living on isn't always good. We live on simply because we are living things with a built-in hunger to grow—like grass reaching for sun, flowers opening. That hunger isn't out there somewhere. It's inside us.


活下去并不总是好的，活下去只是因为我们本是生命体，自有生长的渴望，像草要向阳，花要绽放。这种渴望不在别处，就在我们心里。

We always forget that every single day brings us closer to death. The declining quality of our inner experience starts with that forgetting.


我们总是忘记，每一天都在靠近死亡。心灵体验质量下降，还得从这种遗忘说起。

"Anything is possible" is an illusion. A 0.000001% chance means nothing if you haven't put in the work to stack enough favorable conditions. The result still lands in the 99.999999% failure zone. So don't tell yourself the goal is possible. Tell yourself it's impossible—unless you never stop moving.


一切皆有可能，是个幻象。0.000001%的希望是没有意义，如果没有足够投入去筹集足够多的有利条件，结果仍是落在99.999999%中。所以，不是告诉自己目标是可能实现的，而是应该反过来，告诉自己目标绝不可能实现，除非我马不停蹄。

Life is painfully concrete. You can say "I ate food," but it was some particular thing—eggs? onions? In our ideal picture of life there are no rats, no drudgery, no loss. Abstract spiritual life lets us escape the concrete.

When people say they love life, they usually mean the abstract feeling. They don't love life itself—life itself is too heavy. But my intuition tells me it should be life itself. I don't understand it yet.

生活非常具体，尽管可以概括说吃了食物，但它一定是某种东西，鸡蛋？洋葱？理想的生活里，似乎不会遭遇老鼠、苦役、失去。抽象的精神生活让人逃离具体。

当人们谈论热爱生活，谈论的是抽象精神感受，热爱的并不是生活本身。生活本身太沉重。但我的直觉告诉我，应是生活本身。我还不懂。

In the end, life isn't about telling others what you did. It's about telling yourself. The point of doing many things is to be able to say: this is the posture I faced life with. Even when life is trivial, against my grain, confining—I still faced it and tried to draw growth from it. That's a good posture.


生活到头来，不是告诉别人我做了什么，而是告诉自己。做众多事情的意义在于告诉自己，我是在以什么姿态面对生活。比如，尽管生活会琐碎、违心、局促，我还是面对了它，尝试从中汲取生长的养分。这是好的姿态。
