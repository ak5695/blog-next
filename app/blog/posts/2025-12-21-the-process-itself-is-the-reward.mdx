A few days ago, while heading to the police station to handle a minor errand, I took a route over a highway bridge. Suddenly, I felt the warmth of the sun and the gentleness of the breeze. As far as the eye could see, everything seemed settled and in its rightful place.

前几天去派出所解决一桩琐事，取道一座高架桥，突感风和日暖、目之所及，一副万物安分的乖巧。

In that moment, I found myself detaching from the immediate task, re-evaluating a long-held conclusion: the process itself is the reward; success is merely a part of that process.

那会，我不由抽离事外，重新思考起一个悬挂已久的论断：过程本身就是嘉奖，成事仅是过程的一部分。

Over the past month or so, I've developed five products: some for friends, some for myself, some already profitable in the market, some finished, and others still in development. I've been on this path for two years now, surrounded by a fog of confusion, but by now, I can see progress.

近来一个多月开发了五个产品：给朋友用或自用，也有面向市场已经盈利，有已完工也有正在开发。这条路，我已经走了两年，身前身后尽是困惑的迷雾，不过至此，算是有进步。

Results are important; they point out what was done right and where improvements are needed. Yet, from a higher perspective, they are unimportant. I can't quite articulate it, just as I can't assign a high level of confidence to the aforementioned conclusion.

结果很重要，会指出做对了什么，哪里还不够好。从更高层面来说，它又不重要。我说不清楚，正如无法给前述的论断一个很高的置信水平。

This reminds me of an example I once discussed. A chef wakes up early to source fresh ingredients, travels back laden with bags, then goes through the labor of washing, cutting, and a grand display of cooking, all to produce a table full of dishes.

此时想起以前探讨过的一个例子。一个厨师早起去赶新鲜食材，大包小袋风尘仆仆，清洗斩切、经过好大一阵仗的烹饪，才能整出一大桌菜肴。

The dishes are the result, and everyone's satisfaction is also a result. But if the result is poor, does that negate the chef's morning of hard work?

菜肴是结果，大伙满意也是结果。倘若结果不好呢，是不是就否定了大厨一大早的操劳？

It shouldn't. And for a life that happens only once, it especially shouldn't. Instinct tells me that it would be foolish to negate years or decades of travel and toil just because it ended in failure.

不应该。对于仅此一次的生命来说，更不应该。直觉告诉我，几年、几十年的舟车劳顿、跋山涉水，到头来搞砸了就被否定，这很愚蠢。

Over the years, I've explored quite a few fields: business, technology, language, education. Running through them all has always been a set of abstract perplexities: what is the true meaning of life?

这些年来，也算是探索了不少领域，商业、技术、语言、教育。贯穿其中的，始终是一些抽象的困惑：生活的真谛是什么。

Perhaps limited by methods and mental capacity, there haven't been any grand results. But I've been invested enough that looking back, it feels like I've lived entirely different lives.

可能是囿于方法和算力，并没有太大的结果。不过已经够投入了，以至于回想过去，仿佛截然不同的人生。

Exploration is endless. If I could live a thousand years, I would likely continue in this way. I seem to have adopted this as a way of life.

探索是没有止境的，如果能活一千年，大概也会如此下去。我似乎已经把这当做了一种生活态度。

Why? Because being stuck in one place, shrinking away from reality, constantly consuming the creations of others, and complaining about the world—it's all too boring.

为什么呢？受困某处停滞不前、逃避畏缩不敢直面现实、不断被投喂和消费他人的创作、怨天尤人，都太无聊。

So, is this a different perspective on the answer—an attitude toward life?

所以，这是换一种视角接近答案——面对生活的态度？

Time gives us the opportunity to act, and action reveals an attitude. If a certain way of living is satisfying to oneself, then the process of manifesting that posture is, in itself, the reward.

时间给了我们行动的机会，行动表明了某种态度。如果某种生活姿态是令自身满意的，那么为表明这种姿态的过程，本身就是嘉奖。

The process, life itself, is the reward.

过程、生活，本身就是嘉奖。

I am reminded again: Camus said Sisyphus is happy.

又想起，加缪说西西弗斯是幸福的。

Heh.

嘿。
