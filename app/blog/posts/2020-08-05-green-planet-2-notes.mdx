summary: "We think plants are dull because we move too fast to see them. Once you slow time down, they reveal a world that shakes your sense of what life is and what it means to be conscious."

I have a friend who asked in our group chat the other day: has any one of us found happiness yet? Most people in the group haven’t. Their love lives are a mess. Their bank accounts look like deserts. They lie around tired. Some even say a dog has a better life than we do.

几天前，一个朋友在群里问，我们当中谁幸福了吗？大家的情路坎坷，前途迷茫，整日疲倦躺平，似乎做条狗都比这群人活得舒服。

I told them I was happy. I said this after spending two days watching _Green Planet 2_.

我说，我很幸福。说这话，是因为前两天我一直在看《绿色星球 2》。

Much of life is spent trying to see the world—people, things, cause and effect. But with only our senses, we see very little. We're like frogs in a well. From the view of the universe, we will always be frogs in a well. But even within that sad limit, there’s room for happiness. Life can still glow before the void swallows it.

我们活着的一大部分时间，都在认识世界，看人见物观事。但仅靠六大感官，我们看到的少得可怜，如井底之蛙。即便放在宇宙尺度里，人类永远是井底之蛙，但在这极限悲凉中，仍有幸福的可能，如同死寂来临前生命尚有其欢喜。

I used to believe happiness was about experience: you live, you feel, you leave. Later it grew into wanting to live across time, to spend all the energy in me. Whatever these ideas became, they stayed rooted in this need to know the world. I like this era because it gives me tools to “see” more. The more you see of the unknown, the more room you have to move. Like a space that keeps expanding. And inside it, you can make more noise. That is my kind of happiness.

我曾认为，幸福在于体验，体验完就滚蛋。后来这想法生长，变成我要跨时空地生活，要最大限度释放自己的能量。不管怎么变，它始终扎根于认识世界的土壤。我喜欢这个时代，因为工具越来越多，我能“看见”的世界越来越大，而看见越多，我自由的限度也越大，如不断膨胀的空间，让我可以更加肆意地闹腾。这就是我的幸福。

Among these tools, _Green Planet_ is one of the best. And I mean absurdly good. Plants are everywhere—potted ones, street trees, gardens, farms, forests. I knew the basics: photosynthesis, life, green leaves. I grew up running through woods. I loved forests. But this love was shallow—like someone looking at diamonds and only seeing their hardness or gold and only seeing its color.

在这些工具里，《绿色星球》好得不得了。植物随处可见：盆栽、绿化、植物园、田野、森林。我知道它们光合作用，是生命。我从小横穿野林。我喜欢森林。但这种喜欢很浅，就像看到一堆钻石，只知道它硬；看到黄金，只知道它黄。

The reason our view of plants is so vague is simple: they don’t move fast. Anything that doesn’t move feels dumb. They just sit there in one spot, forever.

我们对植物认识浅薄，原因简单：它们不会动。不会跑。任何不动的东西，看起来都傻乎乎，永远杵在那儿。

Nature documentaries usually give you the big shots—the soaring views from above. I'd often imagine flying over mountains like a bird. This show gives you that, plus the microscopic world, plus the beautiful shots. All good. But none of that was what shook me.

自然纪录片常有鸟瞰镜头，广阔、清朗。我以前常幻想像鸟一样飞越山峦森林。这部片也有，还有显微镜般的微观世界，还有唯美镜头。都很好。但这些都没有震撼到我。

What really hit me was the time-lapse sequences. Watching a plant grow from dirt to leaf. From a small bud to a leaf wider than a person. Watching its tendrils swing through the air like thieves in the night, searching for a grip. Watching flowers scheme to attract animals, quietly trading sweetness for pollination. Watching a cactus use a “nurse tree” in the desert. Watching a flytrap hunt.

真正震撼我的，是延时视角。植物从破土，到长叶，从小芽到两米宽的睡莲；它们的触角在空中摇摆，像夜里的小偷甩着倒钩；花朵心机地散香，引诱动物传播花粉；果实被动物吃下传播种子；食虫植物直接捕猎；沙漠的仙人掌借“保姆树”庇护，或靠特殊分泌物驱赶毛虫。

This isn’t “dumb.” Some of these plants are smarter than I am. At least they know how to look good to attract helpers. I can’t even manage that.

这哪是傻？有些植物比我聪明，至少懂得把花弄漂亮，引诱小动物帮忙繁衍。我呢？只会当条灰头土脸的单身狗。

Imagine your table, chair, cup, walls—all the things you assume are dead—turning out to move at night when you’re not looking. You’d lose your mind. That’s what plants are: things that move, but on a timescale we can’t see. Compress time, and they come alive like animals.

想象一下，你以为死物的桌椅碗盘，有一天被你看到在夜里悄悄乱动，你会不会当场吓死？植物就是这样。它们真的在动，只是我们无法用日常的时间尺度看见。一旦把时间压缩，它们活得像动物一样灵活。

Since then, when I look at plants, I try to “see” them in time-lapse. To see them fight, save, drink, rest, trade, hide, seek. To see them live.

从那以后，我看植物，就会压缩它们的时间，“看”它们如何伸展，如何节省，如何求生，如何社交——如何活着。

If the first shock was sensory—like opening a third eye—the second was a hit to my worldview. Descartes said, “I think, therefore I am.” He meant that everything could be fake except the awareness that questions itself. Consciousness is the core of being human. I used to think only humans had it.

如果第一层震撼是开天眼，那第二层便是世界观的撼动。笛卡尔说“我思故我在”。意思是，一切都可能是假的，唯有能质疑自身的意识是真。我过去认为，只有人才有意识。

But _Green Planet_ shows plants making choices—slow, yes, but choices. Strategies. Adjustments. Something that looks suspiciously like thought. If plants have something like consciousness, then my belief about the essence of being human cracks open.

但《绿色星球》展示了植物不断调整、策略、选择。虽然慢，却像一种某种“意识”。而如果植物也有意识，那我“人的本质是意识体”的观点就裂开了。

I don’t know how to fix that crack. I only know it will cost me hair.

我不知道如何修补这条裂缝。我只知道它肯定让我掉发。

_Green Planet 2_ is a gift, but a heavy one. I didn’t catch it properly. It slammed into the floor of my worldview.

《绿色星球 2》是一份礼物，但太重了，我没接住，砸坏了我的世界观。

Being shaken isn’t happiness. But watching it was.

世界观被震撼不是幸福，但观看《绿色星球 2》是。

The series has five episodes: tropical forests, water, temperate zones, deserts, and human cities. I said earlier that my happiness is to run wild in the space I can see. And this show just opened five new rooms. I haven’t even begun playing in them yet.

这部纪录片有五集：热带雨林、水域、温带、沙漠、人类城市。我之前说，肆意闹腾是我的幸福。《绿色星球 2》为我打开了五个新的视界，而我还没在里面开始想象呢。

So for now, I’ve only opened the gift wrap. The real present is still inside.

所以目前，我也只是拆开了包装纸，真正的礼物还在里面。
