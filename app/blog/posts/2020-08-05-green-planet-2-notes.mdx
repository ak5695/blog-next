summary: "Watching The Green Planet 2 shattered the author's understanding of life: the time-lapse perspective reveals plants' complex, 'conscious' survival strategies, which challenges the author's core philosophical view on human essence. Despite the resulting 'crack' in his worldview, the discovery of such beauty is a profound source of happiness."
summary_zh: "观看《绿色星球2》带来的延迟跟踪视角揭示了植物复杂且“有意识”的生存策略，这震撼了作者关于人类意识本质的哲学观点。尽管世界观因此产生裂缝，但发现世间存在如此美好的事物本身，就是一种巨大的幸福。"

前几天有朋友在群里问，我们当中谁幸福了吗？一个个情路坎坷，一个个钱途迷茫，一个个疲倦躺平，似乎做条狗，都比这群逼要过得舒服。

A few days ago, a friend asked in the group chat which of us was happy. Each of us faced rocky relationships, uncertain finances, and exhausted apathy. It seemed even a dog lived a more comfortable life than this bunch of miserable guys.

我说，我就很幸福。说这话的前两天里，我在看这部纪录片。

I said I was very happy. I had been watching this documentary for the two days prior to saying that.

我们活着的一大部分时间，是在认识世界里，看人见物观事。倘若只用我们自身的六大感官，我们只能看到四周，如井底之蛙所能看见的世界一样大小。虽然，从极限广阔的视野来看，人类始终是井底之蛙，但是那极限悲伤之内，皆可为幸福，正如死寂之前，生命皆可得到幸福（可能的可）。幸福有很多种形式，我曾经认为，生命的幸福在于体验，体验完就滚犊子。这观点后来不断地生长，变成我要超时空地生活，我还想最大限度地释放自身的能量。不管怎么变，我那观念也始终种在认识世界的土壤上。我喜欢这个时代，在这里我得以借助各种工具，“看见”越来越大的世界，越是了解未知的世界，我自由的限度就越大，如一个不断膨胀的空间，我于其中肆意闹腾的程度也就越高，这是我的幸福。

A large part of our lives is spent understanding the world: watching people, observing things, viewing events. If we only use our six senses, we can only see our immediate surroundings, limited like the world seen by a frog in a well. While, from an ultimately vast perspective, humanity remains a frog in a well, within that ultimate sorrow, everything can lead to happiness, just as life can attain happiness before its demise (potentially). Happiness takes many forms. I once believed that the happiness of life lay in experience, and once experienced, one could just roll away. This view later continuously grew, morphing into a desire to live supra-dimensionally, and to maximize the release of my own energy. No matter how it changed, my concept remained rooted in the soil of understanding the world. I love this era because, here, I can use various tools to "see" an ever-expanding world. The more I learn about the unknown world, the greater the limits of my freedom become. It is like an ever-expanding space, and the extent to which I can run riot within it increases—this is my happiness.

那些开了我眼界的工具里，《绿色星球》算一项，这他妈真是好得不得不得的一个工具。说起植物，那可说是无处不在，室内的盆栽，市政的绿化，再往外一些，植物园，田野，农场，森林。我还了解植物，知道它们靠光合作用维持生命，毫无疑问它们也是生命，和人一样。我从小在野林子横穿，我喜欢绿色，喜欢鸟语花香的森林。只是这些认知和喜欢，是朦胧的浅层的，就像一个人对着一堆钻石，只知道欣赏它的刚硬，或者看上黄金的黄。我对植物的看法，之所以如此浅薄和朦胧，只是因为它不会动，不会跑，但凡有生活常识的人都知道，它永远傻不愣登地栽种在一个地方。

Among the tools that opened my eyes, *The Green Planet* is one—this is a damn good tool. Speaking of plants, they are ubiquitous: indoor potted plants, municipal greenery, and further out, botanical gardens, fields, farms, and forests. I already knew about plants, that they sustain life through photosynthesis, and that they are undoubtedly life, just like humans. I grew up traversing wild forests; I love green, and I love forests with singing birds and fragrant flowers. Yet this knowledge and affection were vague and superficial, like someone facing a pile of diamonds, only admiring its hardness, or appreciating the yellowness of gold. My view of plants was so shallow and vague simply because they don't move or run. Anyone with common sense knows they are permanently and stubbornly planted in one place.

野外纪录片，通常会有鸟瞰镜头，广阔，清朗。我以前总想横飞在空中，如鸟一般遨游山峦与森林之上。这部纪录片，还有超微观视角，显微镜级别的，这也很了不起。另外有唯美视角，欣赏它们时我就有一种感觉，那就是这些美，我不会有机会亲眼看到。这三种视角，我都很喜欢，但它们还没震撼我。《绿色星球》真正令我震撼的，是对植物生长的延迟跟踪视角。它把植物漫长的生长，从破土而出，到冒出嫩芽，从小叶苞到直径两米的大叶（睡莲），长出的触角在空中摇摆（不知什么植物），像夜里的小偷甩着倒钩，寻找攀爬点，极有心机地盛开香甜的花朵，在招引动物之中悄无声息地传播自己的花粉，或者通过被动物食下的果实传播种子，甚至有的例如食蝇草直接通过花朵来捕猎，还有沙漠上利用保姆树庇护自身的仙人掌，释放特殊物质来驱赶毛毛虫，还有没有根在沙漠上随遇而安的，旱季蜷缩枯萎作死状，雨季来临就展开“喝水”。这他妈哪是傻不愣登，简直和人类一样聪明，甚至有的植物比我还聪明，至少人家还会通过把花弄漂亮点，好引诱小动物帮忙传播花粉，已达到繁衍后代的目的，老子只会做一条灰头土脸的单身狗。

Wildlife documentaries usually feature aerial shots—vast and clear. I used to want to fly horizontally in the sky, soaring over mountains and forests like a bird. This documentary also has an ultra-microscopic perspective, at the microscope level, which is also extraordinary. In addition, there is an aesthetic perspective, and when I appreciated those scenes, I had a feeling that I would never have the chance to see this beauty with my own eyes. I liked these three perspectives, but they didn't truly shock me. What truly shocked me in *The Green Planet* was the time-lapse perspective on plant growth. It compresses the plants' long growth: from breaking ground and sprouting tender shoots, from small leaf buds to two-meter-diameter leaves (like the water lily), the way extended tendrils sway in the air (from some unknown plant), like a thief in the night swinging a grappling hook, searching for a climbing spot, and the cunning way they unfurl sweet-scented flowers, silently spreading their pollen by attracting animals, or spreading seeds via fruit eaten by animals. Some, like the sundew, even use their flowers to directly hunt insects. There are cactuses in the desert using "nurse trees" for shelter, releasing special substances to ward off caterpillars, and rootless plants that just take life as it comes in the desert, curling up and looking dead during the dry season, only to spread out and "drink" when the rain arrives. How the hell is this stupidity? They are just as intelligent as humans—some plants are even smarter than I am. At least they make their flowers beautiful to lure small animals to help spread pollen for reproduction. All I can do is be a dusty, single dog.

想想看，在你身处的世界里，有一部分事物，如桌椅板凳、杯碗瓢盆、门窗墙壁等等，你一贯认为它们和死的差不多，然而有一天发现，这群家伙是在夜里、暗地里悄悄在动，鬼鬼祟祟地动，那你该有多震惊。而植物，它们是真真实实在动，只不过在日常世界里，无法用可见的时间尺度观察到，在压缩的时间尺度里，它们动得简直与动物一样灵活，完全不是傻不愣登的模样。自那以后，我在闲暇里看植物，便是真看生命，我会压缩他们的生长时间，“看”他们活动，“看”他们如何在雨水与阳光之中施展，在干与旱里节衣缩食，在四季轮回里如何交际繁衍。

Just think: in the world you inhabit, there are things like tables and chairs, cups and bowls, doors and windows, which you always thought were practically dead. Yet, one day you discover that these guys are secretly moving at night, furtively shifting—how shocked would you be? But plants, they are truly and really moving. It's just that, in our daily world, their movement cannot be observed within a visible timescale. In the compressed timescale, they move almost as flexibly as animals, completely dispelling the foolish, static image. Since then, when I look at plants in my free time, I am truly looking at life. I compress their lifespan, "watching" them move, "watching" how they flourish in the rain and sunlight, how they economize and scrimp during dry spells, and how they interact and reproduce through the cycles of the seasons.

如果说延迟视角给我的第一层震撼，是开天眼级的，那第二层震撼，便是世界观的撼动。前者是感官“看见”，后者是精神“看见”。笛卡尔有一句很著名的语录，即“我思故我在”。这句话的含义是，我意识以外的一切，包括我的手脚和脑瓜子，均可能是虚幻的，但是在质疑我意识的真实性时，我无法否认它的存在，因为我意识若不存在，我就没法做出质疑这个动作。而我进一步推断，人的本质属性之一，便是其意识。设想一下，几千万年以后的人类，必定突破生物体的限制，将人转移到靠谱的机器上，不再被囚困在脆弱的肉体之中，但那时人之所以为人，而不是机器，就取决于他具有意识。而意识的属性，我认为是其他生命不具备的。我世界观被撼动得出了裂缝的地方，便是这里。《绿色星球》展示了许多植物独特又神奇的生存策略，它们不断根据环境调整自身，尽管其反应不如人类敏捷迅速，但是撇开时间维度透视那些策略，可见它们具有某种东西，我不知道该用什么形容它，似乎用“意识”来代指最为贴切。这就很他妈坑自己了，如果我得出植物具有意识的结论，那我关于“人的本质是意识体”的观点就没法成立，如果不成立，人的本质是什么呢？

If the time-lapse perspective gave me a first layer of shock—a level of opening a heavenly eye—then the second layer of shock was the shaking of my worldview. The former was the senses "seeing," the latter was the spirit "seeing." Descartes has a very famous quote: "I think, therefore I am." The implication of this sentence is that everything outside my consciousness, including my hands, feet, and brain, might be illusory. However, when questioning the reality of my consciousness, I cannot deny its existence, because if my consciousness didn't exist, I couldn't perform the action of questioning. I further infer that one of the essential attributes of human beings is their consciousness. Imagine humanity millions of years from now, inevitably breaking through the limitations of the biological body, transferring the self onto a reliable machine, no longer imprisoned in a fragile physical body. But at that time, the reason a person would still be a person, and not a machine, would depend on them having consciousness. And the property of consciousness, I believe, is something that other lives do not possess. The place where my worldview was shaken and cracked is right here. *The Green Planet* shows many unique and magical survival strategies of plants. They continuously adjust themselves according to the environment. Although their reactions are not as agile or swift as humans, if one sets aside the time dimension to look through those strategies, it is evident that they possess something. I don't know what to use to describe it; "consciousness" seems to be the most fitting substitute. This is really screwing myself over. If I conclude that plants possess consciousness, then my view that "the essence of humanity is a consciousness entity" cannot be established. If it cannot be established, what, then, is the essence of humanity?

我不知道如何处理这条裂缝，我只知道它肯定会令我掉发秃头。《绿色星球2》简直是一份礼物，只是这份大礼太重了，我一下子没接住，bong一声砸坏了我世界观的底板。世界观被撼动不是幸福的事情，但观看《绿色星球2》则是。世上都有着这么美好事物的存在，光这样想，我就幸福。

I don't know how to handle this crack; I just know it will definitely cause me to lose hair and go bald. *The Green Planet 2* is simply a gift, but this major gift was too heavy. I couldn't catch it all at once, and with a *bong*, it smashed the foundation of my worldview. Having one's worldview shaken is not a happy thing, but watching *The Green Planet 2* is. The mere existence of such beautiful things in the world makes me happy just by thinking about it.

这部纪录片主要是五集，分别介绍热带雨林的、水里的、温带的、沙漠里的、人类社会里的五处典型地区的植物。开头说道，肆意闹腾是我的幸福，《绿色星球2》为我打开的这些视界里，我还没去里面想象。所以说，这份礼物，我还仅是看了它的明信片，解开了精美的包装纸，里面的东西我还没拆呢。

This documentary mainly consists of five episodes, introducing plants from five typical regions: tropical rainforests, aquatic environments, temperate zones, deserts, and human society. As mentioned at the beginning, running riot is my happiness. In the new visions that *The Green Planet 2* opened up for me, I haven't yet gone inside to fully imagine. So, I have only seen the postcard of this gift and unwrapped the exquisite packaging; I haven't yet opened the contents inside.
