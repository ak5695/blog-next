summary_zh: 杰瑞的聪明令我重审人类意识的独特性。在物种层面，人鼠不能共存，但在生命层面，其“总是寻找出路”的内在力量仍是谜。

A mouse (Jerry) slipped into Xiaolingzi’s room. It stared with shiny black eyes from the corner of the wardrobe. It was startling, but she found the novelty compelling: "I’ve never lived, slept, or cohabited with a mouse before!"

小灵子的房间跑进了一只小杰瑞。在衣柜拐角瞪着乌黑油亮的眼睛，不过一转眼就消失掉。“我房间里进老鼠了！”惊吓里似乎带着些许新鲜，“我还没跟老鼠一起住过，睡过，生活过！”

The nightly rustles and plastic chewing soon destroyed the novelty, and her sleep. We set traps—wheat flour, leftover food. Jerry was unimpressed by the Northern cuisine. The bait was untouched. This Jerry was either picky or smart. Likely both. He remained unscathed, seemingly smarter than his host.

夜里总有稀稀疏疏，塑料袋被撕咬的声音。我们网购了老鼠大夹子和粘鼠神贴，盛情招待。但 Jerry 似乎不感冒北方的食物。食物一点没动。这杰瑞老弟，不是挑剔就是聪明。几天下来小灵子布下的老鼠夹，自己都踩了好几次，而杰瑞老弟却是毫发无伤，简直比她还要聪明。

### I. Consciousness as Complexity

Jerry’s intelligence forced me to question my latent **human exceptionalism**. I had always assumed humans possessed unique consciousness.

杰瑞老弟不由令我想起，以前我是一个人类中心论者，总认为人类是独特的，拥有其他低等生物所不具有的意识。

Then, in *The Green Planet*, I watched plants demonstrating survival strategies that looked like thought. Jerry’s wisdom reinforced this. I began to think: the difference between him and me isn’t consciousness versus none, but complexity—more neurons, more intricate processing. Better hands, better tools, better language.

直到在《绿色星球》里，我观察到大量植物都有着自己的生存策略，仿佛都具有类似人类意识一样的东西。杰瑞老弟和我的区别，并不是我有意识而它没有，而是我拥有更多的神经元，能够产生更加复杂的意识活动。

If consciousness isn't unique to humans, then intelligence—its crystallization—isn't either. Perhaps consciousness belongs not to humanity, but to **life**.

如果意识不为人类独有，那么作为意识的结晶——智慧，也不为人类独有。也许意识，可能是生命所独有，而人类只是一种生命形态。

### II. The Code of Sweetness

One day, Xiaolingzi found long-forgotten Sachima wrappers. Jerry had eaten four packs. The wrappers were empty. Clearly, Jerry had a sweet tooth.

这天，小灵子发现床下遗忘已久的沙琪玛，已经被杰瑞吃掉四包。

As the superior predator (Tom, naturally), I had my strategy: the remaining Sachima would be the bait. I put it on a glue board, with two large traps nearby, right where he found pleasure before. I was sure he’d come back.

作为顶级捕猎手的汤姆，我终究还是下场了。我这样远程布局：剩下的沙琪玛不要丢，就当做诱饵。我笃定，它在那里尝到甜头，就一定会重返那儿。

**Humans do. Animals do. It’s coded into the genes of life.**

人如此，动物亦如此，这是刻在生命基因里的规则。

The trap worked. At 5 a.m., he returned to the sweetness, and the snap caught him by the neck.

凌晨五点，当它吭哧吭哧抵达甜蜜乡，“吱”一声，夹子咬住了它的脖子。

### III. The Unknowable Force

Shenzhen has lots of people, lots of trash, and lots of Jerry. They are avatars of plague, incapable of coexisting with us at the species level. Yet, they are products of evolution—another expression of life.

深圳人很多，人多垃圾就多，杰瑞们自然少不了。杰瑞们简直是瘟疫的化身，现代社会不能容忍它们。但我又知道，这是自然界进化的产物，这是生命的另一种形态。

Zoologists say mice have been around for over $40$ million years. It proves this species has always found ways to survive. As one sharp comment on *Blue Planet II* put it: **“Life always finds a way.”**

动物学说，老鼠有四千多万年的历史。这足以说明在漫长的演化进程中，这个物种，一直在寻找出路。正如《蓝色星球 2》里一句精辟的弹幕：“生命总会找到出路”。

I can understand *why* species deceive and kill each other (survival space). But I still don’t understand **life itself**. I don’t know where its force comes from. Why it always seeks a way. What the force to live actually means.

我能理解生命里，物种生存空间的不兼容和尔虞我诈、相互残杀。但我不理解生命。我不理解生命的力量从何而来，生命为何总在寻找出路，生的力量意味着什么。

Jerry found its way into Xiaolingzi’s room—though it took the wrong turn.

这不，有一只就找到小灵子房间来，虽然找错了。

Later, Xiaolingzi took Jerry outside. I asked her if Jerry got to eat the Sachima. She said no. That felt like a pity. As a “Tom” myself, I would’ve preferred he left this world with a full belly.

后来呢，小灵子一大早起来把杰瑞老弟拎出去。我问她杰瑞有没有吃到沙琪玛，她说没有。这就有些遗憾，我这头“汤姆”，倒是希望它吃饱了上路的。
