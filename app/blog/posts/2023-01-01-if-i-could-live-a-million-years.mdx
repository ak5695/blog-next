summary: The difference between living in content and living in method is the difference between drifting and choosing. Meaning isn't given—it’s made.
summary_zh: 生活在内容里是漂流，生活在方式里是选择。意义不是被给予的，而是被创造的。

To live inside **content** is simple: it is defined by consumption and routine.

生活在内容里：

* Eating and sleeping
* Moving your body
* Studying
* Working
* Socializing

吃睡，运动，学习，工作，社交。

To live inside **method** is different. It is defined by intention and action.

生活在方式里：

* I want health. I want more time.
* I want more newness. I don’t want to waste my years.
* I want that tool. I want to solve that problem.
* I want to know *what* it is. I want to know *why* it is.
* I want to know what I must do to reach it, and how I must adjust myself to make it real.

我想要健康，我想要更多的时间，
我想体验更多的新鲜，我想要不虚度，
我想要获得那个工具，我想要解决那个问题，
我想知道是什么，我想知道为什么，
我应该怎么做才能实现，我需要如何调整自己。

Content can answer *what* life is: food, sex, labor. But it cannot answer *why*. Content says only: “This is life.”

内容能回答生活是什么，吃喝、交配、劳动，
回答不了为什么，它会说，生活就是这样。

But method can. Method tells me why I live.

但方式可以，它会告诉我为什么而生活。

To live in method means focus, obsession, the refusal to tire. It means questions pouring in without end—questions I *want* to solve, and questions I **need** to solve.

生活在方式里，意味专注、痴迷、不知疲倦，
意味着源源不断的问题我想去解决，需要我去解决。

This doesn’t necessarily mean joy—unless solving problems itself is joy.

这固然不意味着享受，除非我享受解决问题的过程。

When I know what I want, and I enjoy the process of realizing it, that is arguably a very good life.

当我相对知道想要什么，又享受实现的过程，这应该是非常好的生活。

It can’t escape hardship or pain. Misfortune may still strike the heart.

尽管它无法脱离艰辛和疾苦，因那不幸，仍有几率击中心脏，

For a deer thrown into the jungle, the point isn’t only dodging claws and teeth, or escaping arrows and traps.

但对于一头被丢进丛林的鹿，重要的不仅是躲掉虎爪和狮齿，逃过弓箭和陷阱。

The fundamental fact is that I was created, and dropped into this world. That is the root of everything.

根本的点在于我被创造，被丢进这世间，这是一切的根源，

So what matters even more is giving meaning to life amid the absurd and the meaningless—to ask what I want, to search for how to achieve it, to enjoy the work of solving.

因而更重要的是，于荒诞的无意义中赋予生的意义，去探求我想要什么，探索如何实现，享受解决的过程。

Self-made meaning won’t end the final question of life. That answer lies beyond the world itself. That is the absolute dilemma of being human.

自赋的意义，不会终结生命的终极疑惑，那答案，远在世界本体之外，那是生而为人的绝对困境。

But within the world, *how* I live is the one question I can answer.

在那之内，如何生活才是我能回答的问题，

If I could live a million years, I’d choose to live in **method**—

如果我能活一百万年，那我就选择生活在方式里，

To live in desire, in hope, in thought, in creation—and take that way of living into rice and salt, into joy and sorrow, into birth and death.

生活在欲望、希翼、思想、创造的方式里，带着这个方式去柴米油盐、喜怒哀乐、生老病死。
