summary: A fierce, poetic rebuke to the idea of an all-ruling God who toys with human joy and suffering for his own glory. In the end, the world is better off raw and godless—just itself.
summary_zh: 一首激烈而诗意的斥责：向那位以荣耀自己为名、随意摆弄人间悲喜的全能之神。如果世界刚烈一点，它就是它，与你无关。

## I. Empirical Data: The Unruled Chaos

Life presents a series of intense, uncoordinated events. The meaning is not obvious.

A big tree eloped with a truck, swaying all the way, rustling with laughter. A child sucks his finger, eyelids drooping almost to his navel, yet no milk comes. The sunset runs eastward, perched on a huge glass window, gold turning silver, no longer itself. A girl's cleavage ten centimeters deep lies on the street corner, in alleyways, inside a boy's stifled release—eighteen hundred, overnight.

大树跟着卡车私奔了，摇曳一路，唦唦笑响。小孩吮吸手指，眼皮快垂到肚脐眼里，也没吸出奶奶来。夕阳跑往东边，立在巨大的玻璃窗上，金变银，不像自己不像她。女孩乳沟深十厘，躺街头，躺巷尾，躺进男孩压抑的宣泄，一千八，包夜。

The ambulance is the most tormented: unloading one load of anguish, taking on another of worry, running its legs off with no rest. A package falls in the middle of the road—whoever picks it up rejoices, and someone else's hope is disappointed. A butterfly breaks from its cocoon, light and free, boundless in its flight.

救护车最苦恼，卸下一车焦灼，装上一车忧虑，跑断腿的不得安生。包裹落路中央，谁捡到惊喜，谁的期待又会不满。蝴蝶破茧而生，轻盈一身，自由漫无边界。

All these things, one after another—**what do they mean?**

林林总总，这一切意义何在？

## II. The Rejection of Governance

If pressed, the traditional answer is immediate and complete:

God says: "Only I know. The infinite of infinities is all ruled by me."

神说：“只有我清楚。无限的无限，均由我所统治。”

My response is simpler and more direct: **God, just get the hell away from me.**

我：神啊，你还是滚远一点吧。

You decide life and death, chance, the universe—and then what? The outcomes are chaotic, contradictory, and often tragic.

你决定生死，决定随机，决定宇宙，然后呢？

* The truck runs out of gas, the tree withers halfway through its love.
* The child bites his finger, wakes in pain, helpless.
* The girl puts on her clothes, hesitates, then hurries to the next dream.
* The ambulance can never carry all the world's pain; accidents and the fallen are endless.

卡车没油，大树枯死在爱情半路。小孩咬到手指，痛醒，无依无靠。女孩穿上衣服，犹豫片刻还是赶往下一场梦。救护车装不完世间的苦，总有意外和落难。

Yes. Happiness can turn to misery, the same force that creates dreams can destroy them, fantasy turns to waking, suffering has no end, ambiguity usually comes with surprises, freedom is an endless illusion.

是。幸福可以变悲惨，制造梦境的东西也可以破坏梦境，幻想会变清醒，苦难无止无尽，模棱两可通常还有意外，自由是无止境的幻象。

You can keep mocking, manipulating, toying with us—all for your glory?

你可以一再捉弄、摆弄、玩弄，这一切为荣耀你而来？

### The Logical Implication

Everything is either inside you or outside you.

这一切要么在你之内，要么在你之外，

If these terrible things are within your control, and you allow them for your own amusement, **you're bored.** If these terrible things happen despite your desire to rule, **you're powerless.**

你要么无聊，要么无能。

God, ruler of all things, you must exist, but you don't realize—**you should die.**

神，主宰万物的神，你一定是存在的，但你不知道，你该死了。

## IV. The Final State: A Fierce World

The world does not need your control to achieve its own definition. The chaotic elements of life are better off pursuing their own self-contained paths.

* The butterfly doesn't need to cross the whole world.
* The package can stay unopened in the garbage forever.
* There will always be new kindness to save new suffering.
* The girl can rely on herself and betray no one.
* The sun can play whichever role it wants.
* The child is meant to face life anyway, and if the tree dies, it dies.

蝴蝶用不着飞越全部，包裹于垃圾堆可以一生没开，总会有新的善良去救护新的苦难，女孩自我依靠谁也没辜负，太阳想扮演谁都可以，孩子也本该面对生活，树死了就死了。

Let the world be a little **fiercer**. Then it is simply itself, and has nothing to do with you.

世界刚烈一点，它就是它，与你无关。
